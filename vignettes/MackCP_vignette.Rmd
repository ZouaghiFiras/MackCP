# Introduction

The `MackCP` package provides an implementation of Mack's estimator for calculating reserve estimates in insurance
claims data. This vignette will guide you through the basic usage of the package, demonstrating how to use its primary functions.

## Installation

To install the package from GitHub, you can use the `devtools` package:

```R
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install MackCP from GitHub
devtools::install_github("ZouaghiFiras/MackCP")
```

## Example Dataset

The package comes with a sample dataset called `RAA`. You can load it using the following command:

```R
data(RAA)
head(RAA)
```

## Using Mack's Estimator

### Step 1: Load the Package

First, load the `MackCP` package:

```R
library(MackCP)
```

### Step 2: Estimate Reserves

You can use the `mack_estimator` function to estimate reserves using the `RAA` dataset. Here's how to do it:

```R
# Estimating reserves using Mack's estimator
estimates <- mack_estimator(RAA)
print(estimates)
```

### Step 3: Comparing Results

The package also provides functionality to compare the estimates with those obtained from other methods, such as the `ChainLadder` package. Here's an example:

```R
# Comparing results with ChainLadder
comparison_results <- comparison(estimates)
print(comparison_results)
```

## Utility Functions

The `MackCP` package includes utility functions that can help in various tasks related to reserve estimation. For instance, you can use `utils_function_name()` to perform specific tasks (replace with actual utility function names).

```R
# Example utility function usage
utility_result <- utils_function_name(arguments)
print(utility_result)
```

## Demo Script

To run a demo script showcasing the functionality of the package, you can execute the following command:

```R
demo("demo_script", package = "MackCP")
```

## Conclusion

The `MackCP` package is designed to simplify the process of estimating reserves in insurance claims data using Mack's methodology. This vignette covered the installation, basic usage, and functionality of the package. For more advanced usage and examples, please refer to the documentation.
